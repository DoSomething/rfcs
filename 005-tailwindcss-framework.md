# Tailwind CSS Framework

We should implement the use of [Tailwind CSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) on our user and admin interfaces to help simplify front-end development across our team.

**Discussion:** https://github.com/DoSomething/rfcs/pull/5

## Problem

We have found that with the use of

- Forge pattern library
  - maintainability
  - disparate overrides
- customization

## Proposal

With Tailwind, the team can style items and pages by applying a library of pre-existing classes directly to the HTML.

You can make custom components without needing to write custom CSS, and needing to invent very specific class names.

## Drawbacks/Alternatives

_(Optional)_ Why should we _not_ do this? (Additional complexity, time investment, etc.)

_(Optional)_ Briefly note any alternatives you considered.
