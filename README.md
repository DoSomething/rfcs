  <strong>RFCs:</strong> We use this public repository to discuss and make<br>
  technical decisions, inspired by <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/11/on-an-rfcs-process/">Artsy</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-rfcs">GOV.UK</a>.

## What's all this?
RFCs, or [Request For Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments), are super-nerdy documents traditionally used for discussing computer standards. We 
use a very streamlined version to discuss architectural & process changes within the engineering team.

## Process
**Note:** We'll evolve this process over time! See `001-rfcs.md` for ongoing discussion.
1. Create a new branch on this repo and copy `000-template.md` to `000-my-proposal.md` and fill out the template.
2. Create a pull request. GitHub will automatically post a notification in [#announce-tech](https://app.slack.com/client/T024GV2BW/C782XBKDM) so others can review it. 
3. Rename your proposal based on the PR's number (e.g. for [#1](https://github.com/DoSomething/rfcs/pull/1), we'd name the file `001-rfcs.md`).
4. Once we've reached consensus (loosely defined as two approvals & no blockers), merge in your RFC!
